## Generating the HTML

It's pretty tough trying to organize a page's layout without planning before-hand.  This goes extra when trying to generate a page via code, rather than actually writing out the HTML.

The only way I was able to tackle this issue was actually build a working HTML row the old-fashioned way, so I'd have an idea of what I'm trying to generate and where to append each element.  A bit of design planning early makes life so much easier in the late-game.
